ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* README.md
* build.xml
* releases\
* releases\android-async-http-1.2.0.jar
* releases\android-async-http-1.2.1.jar
* releases\android-async-http-1.3.0.jar
* releases\android-async-http-1.3.1.jar
* releases\android-async-http-1.3.2.jar
* releases\android-async-http-1.4.0.jar
* releases\android-async-http-1.4.1.jar
* releases\android-async-http-1.4.2.jar
* releases\android-async-http-1.4.3.jar

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => androidasynchttp\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* examples\ => androidasynchttp\src\main\java\
* src\ => androidasynchttp\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
